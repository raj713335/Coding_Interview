**Python solution** for the `ShortestPath(strArr)` problem based on the prompt shown in the image. We'll build a graph from the input array and perform a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to find the shortest path from the first node to the last node.

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def ShortestPath(strArr):
    n = int(strArr[0])
    nodes = strArr[1:n+1]
    connections = strArr[n+1:]

    # Create an adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for conn in connections:
        a, b = conn.split('-')
        graph[a].append(b)
        graph[b].append(a)  # Since the graph is undirected

    start = nodes[0]
    end = nodes[-1]

    # BFS to find the shortest path
    queue = deque([(start, [start])])
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        current, path = queue.popleft()
        if current == end:
            return '-'.join(path)

        visited.add(current)
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))

    # If no path is found
    return "-1"

# Example usage:
print(ShortestPath(["5", "A", "B", "C", "D", "F", "A-B", "A-C", "C-D", "D-F"]))  # Output: A-C-D-F
print(ShortestPath(["4", "X", "Y", "Z", "W", "X-Y", "Y-Z", "X-W"]))            # Output: X-W
```

### Key Points:

* Converts the node list and connections into a graph.
* Uses BFS to guarantee the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
* Returns the path in dash-separated format if found, otherwise `-1`.
